Identify chiral centers, linkages, and any unusual features.\n\n2. **Identify the most obvious disconnection point**: Look for common synthetic transformations (C-C bond formation, functional group interconversions, protecting group manipulations).\n\n3. **When initial hypothesis fails, carefully analyze the feedback**: Pay special attention to structural differences between your prediction and the correct answer. Look for missing or extra functional groups.\n\n4. **Recognize protecting group patterns**: If the product has a free functional group (amine, alcohol, carboxylic acid), consider that the reactant might have that group protected. Common protecting groups include Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl), Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl), Fmoc, TBDMS, etc.\n\n5. **Work backwards from the difference**: If the product has structure A and the correct reactant has structure A + protecting group B, the transformation is deprotection of B.\n\n6. **Verify the complete structure**: Ensure all other parts of the molecule (stereochemistry, existing functional groups, linkages) remain unchanged between reactant and product.\n\n7. **Format the answer correctly**: Provide only the SMILES string(s) in the answer tags, with multiple reactants separated by dots if needed.",
